## Usage
This application is designed to serve as a Text Editor that runs in the browser. It will allow the user to type code that is formatted using Code-Mirror-Themes and it will cache this code in the browser using indexDB. This application meets the criteria of a PWA and the user can install it to their machine using the install button on the homepage. Once installed, it will mimick a native application and run outside of the browser in it's own window.
